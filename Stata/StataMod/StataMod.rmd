## Setup

### Class Structure and organization 

* Informal --- Ask questions at any time. Really!
* Collaboration is encouraged - please spend a minute introducing yourself to your neighbors!
* If you are using a laptop, you will need to adjust file paths accordingly
* Make comments in your Do-file - save on flash drive or email to yourself


### Prerequisites

This is an intermediate-level Stata modeling workshop 

* Assumes basic knowledge of Stata
* Not appropriate for people already well familiar with modeling in Stata
* If you are catching on before the rest of the class, experiment with command features described in help files


## Modeling workflow

Before we delve into the details of how to fit models in Stata, it's worth taking a step
back and thinking more broadly about the components of the modeling process. These
can roughly be divided into 3 stages:

1. Pre-estimation
2. Estimation
3. Post-estimaton

At each stage, the goal is to complete a different task (e.g., to clean data, fit a model, test a hypothesis),
but the process is sequential --- we move through the stages in order (though often many times in one project!)

![](C:/Users/Yihan/.git/dss-workshops/Stata/StataMod/images/Stata_model_pipeline.png)

Throughout this workshop we will go through these stages several times as we fit different types of model.


## Goals

<div class="alert alert-success">
**We will learn about the Stata modeling by analyzing data from three datasets.** In particular, our goals are:

1. Run OLS regression following modeling workflow 
2. Run logistic regression following modeling workflow 
3. Estimate marginal effects in a OLS regression 
4. Estimate marginal effects in a logistic regression 
</div>


## Models with continuous outcome

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: To learn modeling with continuous outcome in Stata.** In particular:

1. Set working directory and load data 
2. Examine descriptive statistics
3. Look at relationship graphically and test correlation(s)
4. Run an initial model and retest the model 
5. Add interaction and categorical predictors 
</div>


### Today's Dataset

* We have a dataset (``states.dta``) on a variety of variables for all 50 states
* Variables include population, density, energy use, voting tendencies, graduation rates, income, etc.

* We're going to be predicting mean composite SAT score using education expense, median family income,     and % of HS graduates taking SAT.
* Does the amount of money spent on education (``expense``), family income(``income``), and percentage of   students taking SATs (``percent``)affect the mean SAT score (``csat``) in a state? 


### Set working directory 

* Look at bottom left hand corner of Stata screen
    + This is the directory Stata is currently reading from
* Files are located in the dataSets folder in StataMod
* Start by telling Stata where to look for these

```{stata}
  // change directory
  cd "~/Desktop/Stata/StataMod"
```


* Use dir to see what is in the directory:

```{stata}
  dir
  cd dataSets
```


### Load the data

```{stata}
  // use the states data set
  use dataSets/states.dta
```


### Examine descriptive statistics 

```{stata}
  // descriptive statistics 
  sum expense income percent csat
```


### Test correlations 

```{stata}
  // test correlations 
  scatter expense income
  scatter expense percent 
  
  pwcorr csat expense income percent
  pwcorr csat expense income percent, sig
```


### Fit the model 

To fit a model in Stata, we first have to convert our theoretical model into
a `formula` --- a symbolic representation of the model in Stata syntax:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# formula for model specification
regress outcome pred1 pred2 pred3
```

For example, the following model predicts SAT scores based on the amount of money spent on education (``expense``), family income(``income``), and percentage of students taking SATs (``percent``) in a state. 

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
$$
csat_i = \beta_01 + \beta_1expense_i + \beta_2income_i +\beta_3percent_i + \epsilon_i
$$
</div>

* regress csat on expense, income, and percent 

```{stata}
  regress csat expense income percent 
```


#### OLS assumptions

OLS regression relies on several assumptions, including:

1. The model includes all relevant variables (i.e., no omitted variable bias).
2. The model is linear in the parameters (i.e., the coefficients and error term).
3. The error term has an expected value of zero.
4. All right-hand-side variables are uncorrelated with the error term.
5. No right-hand-side variables are a perfect linear function of other RHS variables.
6. Observations of the error term are uncorrelated with each other.
7. The error term has constant variance (i.e., homoscedasticity).
8. (Optional - only needed for inference). The error term is normally distributed.


### Test model assumptions 

* A simple histogram of the residuals can be informative

```{stata}
  // graph the residual values of csat
  predict resid, residual
  histogram resid, normal 
```

* Examine homoscedasticity

```{stata}
  rvfplot, yline(0)
```

* Type -help regress postestimation- for more information about these statistical tools. 

* Refit the model if necessary 


### Interactions

* What if we wanted to test an interaction between percent & high?
   + Option 1: generate product terms by hand

```{stata}
  // generate product of percent and high
  gen percenthigh = percent*high 
  regress csat expense income percent high percenthigh
```

   + Option 2: Let Stata do your dirty work

```{stata}
  // use the # sign to represent interactions 
  regress csat percent high c.percent#c.high
  // same as . regress csat c.percent##high
```


### Categorical predictors

* For categorical variables, we first need to dummy code
* Use region as example

    + Option 1: create dummy codes before fitting regression model

```{stata}
  // create region dummy codes using tab 
  tab region, gen(region)

  //regress csat on region
  regress csat region1 region2 region3
```

    + Option 2: Let Stata do it for you

```{stata}
  // regress csat on region using fvvarlist syntax
  // see help fvvarlist for details
  regress csat i.region
```


### Exercise 0

**Regression with continuous outcome**

Open the datafile, ``gss.dta``

Fit a OLS regression model to predict general happiness (``happy``) based on respondent's sex (``sex``), marital status (``marital``), highest year of school completed (``educ``), and respondent's income for last year (``rincome``). 

1.  Before running the regression, examine descriptive of the variables and generate a few scatterplots.

```{stata}
##

```

2.  Run your regression model. 

```{stata}
##

```

3.  Examine the plausibility of the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. 

```{stata}
##

```

4.  Add on to the regression equation by generating an interaction term between ``sex`` and ``educ`` and testing the interaction.

```{stata}
##

```

## Exporting & saving results

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: To learn how to store and export Stata models.** In particular:

1. How to store results and compare between models 
2. How to export stata model to Excel 
</div>


### Regression tables

* Store and compare results 
* Stata offers several user-friendly options for storing and viewing regression output from multiple models
* First, download the necessary packages:

```{stata}
 // install outreg2 package
findit outreg2
```


### Saving & replaying

* You can store regression model results in Stata

```{stata}
  // fit two regression models and store the results
regress csat expense income percent high
estimates store Model1
  
regress csat expense income percent high i.region
estimates store Model2
```


* Stored models can be recalled

```{stata}
  // Display Model1
estimates replay Model1
```


* Stored models can be compared

```{stata}
  // Compare Model1 and Model2 coefficients
estimates table Model1 Model2
  // Compare Model1 and Model2 fit 
lrtest Model1 Model2 
```


### Exporting to Excel

* Avoid human error when transferring coefficients into tables
* Excel can be used to format publication-ready tables

```{stata}
outreg2 [Model1 Model2] using csatprediction.xls, replace
```


## Models with binary outcome

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: To learn modeling with binary outcome in Stata.** In particular:

1. Set working directory and load data 
2. Run summary statistics for outcome variable and predictors
3. Run the model to obtain log odds and odds ratio 
</div>


### Today's Dataset

* Using the ``states.dta``, we're going to be predicting binary SAT score (>=1000; <1000) using people per square mile, percent HS graduates taking SAT, and per pupil expenditures for primary and secondary school.

* Does people per square mile (``density``), percent HS graduates taking SAT (``percent``), and per pupil expenditures for primary and secondary school (``expense``) affect SAT performance in a region (``csat``)? 

### Load the dataset

```{stata}
  // use the states data set
  use dataSets/states.dta
```

### Recode the outcome variable 

* Recode the composite SAT score (``csat``) into two categories **whether a region's mean SAT score is higher than or eaqul to, or lower than 1000.**

```{stata}
gen sat_binary = .
replace sat_binary = 0 if csat < 1000
replace sat_binary = 1 if csat >= 1000

```

### Run summary statistics 

```{stata}
tab sat_binary
sum density percent expense 

```


### Run the logit model 

Let's predict the probability of having mean SAT score greater than or equal to 1000 based on ``density``, ``percent``, and ``expense``.

Here's the model:

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
$$
logit(sat_i) = \beta_01 + \beta_1densityp_i + \beta_2percent_i + \beta_3expense_i + \epsilon_i 
$$
</div>

where $logit(\cdot)$ is the link function, which is equivalent to the log odds of ``sat``:

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
$$
logit(sat_i) = ln \frac{p(sat_i = 1)}{p(sat_i = 0)}
$$
</div>


```{stata}
 // logit regression outcome on a log odds scale 
logit sat_binary density percent expense
 // logit regression outcome on a odds ratio scale 
logit sat_binary density percent expense, or 
```


### Exercise 1

**Regression with binary outcome**

Use the data file, ``gss.dta``. Examine how age of a respondent (``age``), highest year of school completed (``degree``), hours per day watching TV (``tvhours``), and total family income for last year (``income``) relate to whether someone uses internet (``usenet``). 

1.  Load the dataset. 

```{stata}
##

```

2.  Run summary statistics, delete the sample who did not provide an answer. 

```{stata}
##

```

3.  Fit the logit model and save it as Model 1. 

```{stata}
##

```

4.  Add another predictor (``hrs1``) in the model and save the new model as Model 2 and compare between Model 1 and Model 2. 

```{stata}
##

```

5.  Save the output of the better fitted model to a word document. 

```{stata}
##

**Why use margins?** 
  
1. Marginal effect tells us how a dependent variable changes when a specific independent variable 
   changes. When estimating marginal effect, other covariates are assumed to be held constant. 
2. Marginal effects can provide us more meaningful information regarding how changes of a predictor 
   relate to the outcome. It is often calculated when analyzing regression analysis results.
3. Stata provides us a handy tool ``margins`` command to estimate marginal effect. 
4. The margins command can only be used after you've run a regression, and acts on the results of the       most recent regression command. 
5. There are different types of margins. We will explain three most common marginal effect below.  


## Margins with OLS regression 

<div class="alert alert-info">
  **GOAL: To learn margins with continuous outcome in Stata.** In particular:
  
1. Margins by itself 
2. Margins for categorical predictor 
3. Margins for continuous predictor 
4. Marginsplot 
</div>
  
  
### Our dataset 
  
* The case study examples use the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) 
  which was conducted in the mid to late 1970s. 
* We will examine systolic blood pressure (``bpsystol``) based on respondent's age (``age``), whether      having diabetes (``diabetes``), and region (``region``).
* The example is completely made up for the purpose of demonstrating margins command. The model is not     based on any medical research or theoretical knowledge whatsoever. 
* Stata provides online access to an adultsonly extract from these data.
* More on the study can be found at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes2/
  
### Load the data 
    
```{stata}
use dataSets/nhanesII.dta

``` 

### Fit the model 

```{stata}
regress bpsystol age i.diabetes i.region

```

### Margins by itself 

* If you just type ``margins`` by itself, Stata will calculate the preducted value of ``bpsystol`` for each observation, then report the mean value of those predictions.  

```{stata}
margins

```

### Margins for categorical predictor 

* If margins is followed by a categorical variable, for example, ``region``, Stata first identifies all the levels of the categorical variable. Then, it calculates what the mean predicted value of ``bpsystol`` would be if all observations had that value for ``region``. All other variables are left unchanged. 

```{stata}
 // margins for dummy variable 
margins, diabetes
 // margins for categorical variable 
margins, region

```

### Margins for continuous predictor 

* For continuous variables, ``margins`` cannot look at all possible values, but we can specify which values we want to examine with the ``at`` option: 

```{stata}
margins, at(age = (50 80))
```

* The previous step calculates the mean predicted value of ``bpsystol`` with age set to 50, and then again with age set to 80. We can also add more values by listing the numbers you want in a *numlist*:

```{stata}
margins, at(age=(50(5)80))

```

### Marginsplot 

* The previous step calculates the mean predicted value of ``bpsystol`` with age set to 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, and 80. We can further use ``marginsplot`` to graph the results. 

```{stata}
marginsplot

```


### Exercise 2

**Margins with OLS regression**
  
Open the datafile ``gss.dta``

1. Based on the previous model you specified in Exercise 0, obtain predicted general happiness (``happy``).

Fit a OLS regression model to predict general happiness (``happy``) based on respondent's sex     (``sex``), marital status (``marital``), highest year of school completed (``educ``), and respondent's income for last year (``rincome``). 

```{stata}
##

```

2. Obtain predicted margins of ``sex`` and ``marital``. 

```{stata}
##

```

3. Obtain predicted margins of ``rincome`` from 10000 to 30000, with an interval of 5000. 

```{stata}
##

```

4. Create a marginsplot and interpret the results. 

```{stata}
## 

```
